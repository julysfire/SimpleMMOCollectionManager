# SimpleMMO Collection Manager

#### Description
A Chrome(Chromium based) browser extension that helps determine if you have already collected an item or collectible.  This extension store a list of all the collectibles and equipment that you have added to your collection and when you go to your inventory, will display a green checkmark next to the item name if you have collected that item already.  If you have not collected the item, it will display a red exclamation mark next to the item name.

#### Installation
Currently, this is not on the chrome web store.  Once I do some more development on the extension, I will get it uploaded to the web store.

1. Download the .zip from the above or via releases
2. Unzip to wherever you would like to save the extension
3. Navigate to "chrome://extensions"
4. At the top right of the page should  be "Developer mode" with a slide bar, click that slide.
5. You should not have a "Load Unpacked" button in the top right.  Select that and navigate to where the unzipped folder is located.
